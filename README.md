# Unua - A FOSSBilling client theme

Experimental client theme for FOSSBilling, with a focus on semantic markup, accessibiity, and customisability.

## Important!

This theme introduces some customisation options that require additoinal javascript and css to be loaded into the admin theme template to work properly. 

The aim is for this to be done from the files within this theme, but at this moment changes need to be made to the admin theme template for things to work properly - the updated template can be found in the admin folder of this repo. 

## Notes / FAQ answers

- This is built largely as a project to test ideas and concepts, experiment with modern CSS, and as a learning project for myself.
- This theme is not built using any existing layout/style frameworks, i.e. Bootstrap or Tabler. This is by design and will not change. 
- It does not look like and is not intended to look like Huraga (FOSSBilling default client theme).
- It is currently very incomplete and a work in progress.
